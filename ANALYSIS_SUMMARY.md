# Analysis Summary: Code Slowdown After Upstream Sync

## Question Asked
> "Look at the differences before and after I synced with upstream (ci-group), and tell me what possible reasons for code slowdown there could be for my examples/A3_modified.py"

## Answer

### Primary Cause: Duration Parameter Ambiguity in `continue_simple_runner()`

The upstream sync added a new function `continue_simple_runner()` to `src/ariel/utils/runners.py` that has an **ambiguous duration parameter**.

#### The Problem

```python
def continue_simple_runner(model, data, duration=10.0, steps_per_loop=100):
    while data.time < duration:  # ⚠️ Is this absolute time or incremental?
        mujoco.mj_step(model, data, nstep=steps_per_loop)
```

Your configuration has:
```python
duration_flat: int = 15      # First segment
duration_rugged: int = 30    # Second segment  
duration_elevated: int = 55  # Third segment
```

#### Two Possible Interpretations

**Interpretation 1: Absolute Times** (current implementation)
- Simulation runs until `data.time` reaches the specified value
- Total time: 15 + (30-15) + (55-30) = **55 seconds**

**Interpretation 2: Incremental Durations** (possible original intent)
- Simulation adds the specified duration to current time
- Total time: 15 + 30 + 55 = **100 seconds**

#### Impact: 82% Difference!

```
Current behavior:     [====55 seconds====]
Possible intent:      [==============100 seconds==============]
Missing time:                            [====45 seconds====]
```

### Why This Causes "Slowdown"

If your code expects 100s simulations but gets 55s:

1. **Robots travel shorter distances** → appear less capable
2. **Fitness scores are lower** → different selection in EA
3. **Fewer robots pass checkpoints** → different evolutionary pressure
4. **EA makes different progress** → appears to "slow down" or stagnate
5. **Results don't match expectations** → confusion about performance

### How to Fix

**Option 1: Make Duration Incremental** (if 100s is correct)

Edit `src/ariel/utils/runners.py`, line 64:

```python
def continue_simple_runner(model, data, duration=10.0, steps_per_loop=100):
    """Continue a simple headless simulation for an additional duration."""
    end_time = data.time + duration  # ← Add this line
    while data.time < end_time:      # ← Change this line
        mujoco.mj_step(model, data, nstep=steps_per_loop)
```

**Option 2: Update Config** (if 55s is correct)

Rename variables in `examples/A3_modified.py` for clarity:

```python
duration_initial: int = 15        # 0 → 15s
total_time_after_rugged: int = 30     # 0 → 30s total
total_time_after_elevated: int = 55   # 0 → 55s total
```

### How to Verify Which Is Correct

1. **Run the test:**
   ```bash
   python test_duration_semantics.py
   ```

2. **Check your expectations:**
   - Should simulations be 55s or 100s total?
   - Are checkpoint locations reasonable for 55s vs 100s?
   - What are historical fitness value ranges?

3. **Monitor actual behavior:**
   - Add logging to see actual simulation times
   - Check checkpoint pass rates
   - Compare fitness distributions

### Recommendation

**Most Likely:** The duration parameters were meant to be incremental (100s total), so:

1. ✅ Apply Option 1 fix to `src/ariel/utils/runners.py`
2. ✅ Test with a few EA runs
3. ✅ Verify fitness values return to expected ranges
4. ✅ Confirm checkpoint pass rates improve

### Additional Minor Issues

While analyzing, I also found these minor issues (not primary causes of slowdown):

1. **No controller state reset** in `continue_simple_runner`
   - Impact: Minimal, controller stays active
   - Urgency: Low

2. **Checkpoint timing assumptions**
   - Impact: Depends on duration interpretation
   - Fix: Will be correct once duration is fixed

### Upstream Changes

The merge commit `b465e55` ("Merge remote-tracking branch 'upstream/main'") added:
- New `continue_simple_runner()` function
- Many infrastructure files (`.devcontainer/`, `.typings/`, etc.)
- No direct changes to your `A3_modified.py` (it's your custom file)

### Root Cause Analysis

This issue is a classic example of:
- **Ambiguous parameter naming**: `duration` could mean different things
- **Missing documentation**: No clear spec of absolute vs incremental
- **Silent behavior change**: No error, just different behavior

Better API design would use:
- `target_time` for absolute times
- `additional_duration` for incremental times

---

**Bottom Line:** The most likely cause of your code "slowdown" is that simulations are running for 55 seconds instead of the expected 100 seconds, due to how the new `continue_simple_runner()` function interprets duration parameters. The fix is a simple 2-line change to make durations incremental instead of absolute.
